# hand-sign-detection

In this repository, you will find an AI project that aims to detect Naruto's hands seals in real time, as you can see in the GIF below:

##Introduction

Since I discovered the world of computer vision, I’ve been fascinated by how it works and the cool projects you can build with it. If you’ve ever watched Naruto, you probably remember the hands seals, right? It's a concept of controlling the five elements using hand gestures, as you can see in the image below:

During my AI studies, I thought, what if I could create a computer vision system that recognizes these hand seals in real-time? Well, that’s exactly what I did, and this repository contains all coding I created to reach this goal.

A detailed tutorial about this project was posted on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIE9g0209xk&t=6s).
